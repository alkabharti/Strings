Given two strings a and b consisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. 
An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. 
For example, act and tac are an anagram of each other.

Example 1:

Input:a = geeksforgeeks, b = forgeeksgeeks
Output: YES
Explanation: Both the string have samecharacters with same frequency. So, both are anagrams.

  Example 2:

Input:a = allergy, b = allergic
Output: NO
Explanation:Characters in both the strings are not same, so they are not anagrams.
